This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

From the monorepo root, run `yarn` to install the dependencies for the entire project, including the root and the `ui` package.

**NOTE:**  In general, it is best practice to run all `package.json` scripts from the monorepo root, by running `yarn workspace ui <script-name>`, or `yarn ui:dev`, e.g.

First, run the development server (from the monorepo root):

```bash
yarn ui:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
